3. Browse the repository and locate the LeetCode problem you are interested in.

# Problem Format
Each problem has its own folder inside the repository. The folder name should follow the format: `problem-[problem-number]-[problem-name]`.
<br/>
Inside each problem folder, you will find the following files:

- `README.md`: This file contains the problem description and any additional information about the problem.
- `solution.[extension]`: This file contains the solution to the problem in the programming language specified by the extension (e.g., `solution.py` for Python).
  <br />
If a problem has multiple solutions, you can add them with different file names, such as `solution1.java`, `solution2.py`, etc.
